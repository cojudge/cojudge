You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

`nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order and return the merged array.

**Constraints:**

- nums1.length == m + n
- nums2.length == n
- 0 ≤ m, n ≤ 200
- 1 ≤ m + n ≤ 200
- -10^9 ≤ nums1[i], nums2[j] ≤ 10^9
